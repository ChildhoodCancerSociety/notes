1. `main.py`:

* This is the core file of the Discord bot where the main functionality is implemented.
* It initializes the bot, loads the different cogs (modules), and handles events.
* Team members are not required to modify this file, allowing the functionality to remain stable as they develop features in their own cogs and helper functions.

2. `cogs/my_cog.py`:

* This file is designated for specific features or commands that can be added to the bot.
* Team members can design their own cogs by defining classes here, which inherit from the base classes provided by `Discord.py`.
* This modular approach enables each member to work on their features independently.

3. `utils/`:&#x20;

* This where we will store source files which aid cog functionality. Within this directory, there is also a `helpers.py` file that houses generic functions available to all cogs.

4. `utils/helpers.py`:

* This file is intended to contain utility functions that can be used across different modules of the bot.
* Team members can develop functions that perform specific tasks and can be used in their cogs, promoting code reusability.

5. `cache/`:&#x20;

* This folder is used to store sub-folders containing cache files for the bot.

6. `config/`:&#x20;

* This folder is used to store configuration files for the `bot/cogs`.
