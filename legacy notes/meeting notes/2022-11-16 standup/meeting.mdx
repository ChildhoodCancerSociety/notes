* Other potential projects
  * Discord bot
  * Asset pipeline



## Epilogue

### Presentation/ Note-taking module

* why?
  * lots of info, easy to forget or misplace small details
  * no easy way to centralize note-taking around organization
    * (that doesnt involve Google Drive)
  * lots of meetings, need to empower PMs and other team members
* powered primarily by `mdx-deck`
  * not a good idea :(
    * DPI scaling issues
    * uses gatsby internally (gross!)
    * would need to rebuild most of the build pipeline or at least change the gatsby parts to figure out relative linking
    * build output is \~400 files and \~8MB (!!!) and takes longer than I'd like (\~3-4 seconds for a single page)
  * evaluating `MDXP` as a replacement
  * any other presentation software (does not have to be mdx/node/web based!) is fine



## TODO

* find some replacement for `mdx-deck`
* dev tooling + base presentation/ note compilation (located in `index.js`)
* build tooling
  * does not exist :P
  * run `npx mdx-deck [whatever .mdx file]` and then copy output from repo `public` directory into new
    * none of this currently works anyway
* deployment
  * currently handled via github pages
  * doesnt even work due to aforementioned relative path issues
* documentation
