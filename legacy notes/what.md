# What is this? ðŸ’€

Before we landed on Gitbook (we might not even be using this in the future, who knows!) we had this repo organized as a collection of markdown files + assets with an Obsidian configuration. The resulting file structure + formatting was a little ugly when converted to Gitbook, so we've preserved them here in their original forms, in perpetuity. We might delete this later. Who knows.
