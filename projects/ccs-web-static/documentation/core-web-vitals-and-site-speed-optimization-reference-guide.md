### Introduction to Core Web Vitals and Site Speed

#### Why Core Web Vitals Matter

* Impact on Google's search rankings.
* Measure of user experience quality.

#### Connection Between Site Speed and User Experience

* Faster sites enhance user satisfaction.
* Leads to higher retention and conversion rates.

### Deep Dive into Core Web Vitals

#### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

* Measures loading performance.
* Faster LCP = quicker page usability.

#### First Input Delay (FID)

* Quantifies site interactivity.
* Low FID = responsive site to user interactions.

#### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

* Assesses visual stability.
* Low CLS = stable and predictable content.

### Essentials of Site Speed Optimization

#### Critical Rendering Path

* Sequence of resource loading and rendering.
* Optimization for faster content display.

#### Page Load Time

* Time to fully display content.
* Faster load times reduce bounce rates.

### Optimizing Website Assets

#### Minification of CSS, JavaScript, HTML

* Remove unnecessary code characters.
* Reduces file size, speeds up loading.

#### Image Optimization

* Correct formats and compression.
* Balances load speed with quality.

#### Efficient Web Fonts Loading

* Early legibility of text during page load.

#### Managing Third-party Scripts

* Reduces load times by limiting external script reliance.

### Server-side and Hosting Optimizations

#### Server Response Times

* Faster servers = quicker site loads.

#### Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

* Distribute content globally.
* Serve users from the nearest location.

#### Browser Caching

* Speeds up load time for repeat visitors.

#### Implementing Compression

* Reduces file sizes for faster load times.

### Rendering and Front-end Optimizations

#### Asynchronous Loading

* Parallel resource loading.
* Prevents blocking of main content.

#### Code Splitting

* Deliver only necessary code for each page.

#### Service Workers

* Enable caching and offline capabilities.

#### SSR and SSG

* Techniques to optimize website rendering.

### Advanced Web Technologies for Enhanced Speed

#### Progressive Web Apps (PWA)

* Native-like experience with features like offline access.

#### Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)

* Fast-loading mobile pages framework by Google.

### Monitoring, Tools, and Analytics for Site Speed

#### Google Lighthouse

* Automated website quality measurement tool.

#### Google PageSpeed Insights

* Recommendations for site performance improvement.

#### GTmetrix

* Evaluates and suggests optimizations for site speed.

### Troubleshooting Common Speed and Core Vitals Issues

#### Main Thread Work Bottlenecks

* Identifying and addressing tasks that delay rendering.

#### Layout Shifts

* Preventing unexpected content movement.
