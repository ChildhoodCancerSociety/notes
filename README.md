# Notes

Meeting notes for the CCS dev team, using mdx/ markdown

## How to use

Folders are named in lowercase and .md files are capitalized with the exception of [README.md](README.md) and [TODO](TODO.md). (nobody is enforcing this lol)

### [meetings](meetings/Meetings.md)
These include weekly Wednesday standups and any ad hoc meetings. Will likely also include notes from office hours in the future.

### [notes](notes/Notes.md)
Ad hoc notes on dev group policy (and that's it for now).

### [scripts](scripts/README.md)
The wheels that make this car move!
